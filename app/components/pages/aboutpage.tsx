Let me share the pivotal journey that's shaped my career trajectory. Over the last decade I delved into the world of insurance, navigating its complexities without the backing of a college degree. Despite my dedication, an inner yearning urged me toward uncharted territories, away from the traditional confines of my role.
</p>
<p className="m-5 text-justify">
As I honed my skills in insurance, I stumbled upon a revelation â€“ the dynamic world of software development. Crafting a website for my employer, I found myself drawn to the intricate language of code. This newfound passion ignited a fire within me, compelling me to pursue proficiency in programming. 5 years later, I realized that it was the correct time to transition from the insurance industry to the tech industry.
</p>
<p className="m-5 text-justify">
Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and fueled by an unwavering belief in my abilities, I made the bold decision to transition into coding.

In September of 2023 I signed up for the University of North Carlina at Charlotte full stack boot camp. A 3 month program where I was taught over 24 differnt topics from HTML and CSS to javascript, React.js and more for front end development. Node.js Express.js and more for backend-development and over 3 different types of servers including MySQL, MongoDB, and Graphql.  Over the last seven months, I have immersed myself in programming languages, overcoming obstacles with determination and grit. Despite the absence of a conventional college education, I persevered, propelled by the conviction that passion and dedication can overcome any obstacle.

<p className="m-5 text-justify">
Continuing my education after class has made me discover new technologies such as Next.js which is the language this site is on Tailwindcss which it is styled by and Postgresql which I am still learning. 
</p>
<p className="m-5 text-justify">
Coding is my passion and I am eager to contribute to the tech industry, leveraging my unique background to bring a fresh perspective to the table. I am excited to embark on this new chapter, eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
